<h4>The source code for the 2nd place winner in the national cyber championship</h4>

<span>
Written by Eyal Godovich, Tor Hadas and Gal Bloch.

<b>Warning</b>: The code won't work/compile out of the box because we removed the most-important function ("GetBestCombinations"). 
The function was removed because we don't want anyone copying our code and winning the 2018 championship by doing so.
